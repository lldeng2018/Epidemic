EPIDEMIC SIMULATOR
==================

Author:  Douglas W. Jones
Version: Apr. 20, 2021

The code in this directory includes a solution to Machine Problem 11 from
CS:2820 at the University of Iowa.

This epidemic simulator takes an input file containing a description of the
places in a community, the roles fulfilled by the population of that community
and the nature of the disease.  The output is a CSV file showing the progress
of the disease through the community.

Files
-----

This directory contains the following source files for the epidemic simulator:

* Error.java		error reporting framework
* MyScanner.java	Wrapper around java.util.scanner
* Check.java		Utility to do sanity checks on values
* MyRandom.java		Extensions to Java.util.random
* Simulator.java	Simulation framework
* Time.java		Definitions of time units

* InfectionRule.java	How do stages of the infection progress
* Schedule.java		How do people decide to move from place to place
* Person.java		How does each person behave, also population statistics
* Place.java		How does each place work
* PlaceKind.java	What kinds of places are there
* Role.java		What kinds of roles to people fit into

* Epidemic.java		the main program

The following additional files are included

* README		this file
* Makefile              instructions for building and running the simulator

* testa			test input, workers spread disease between families
* testb			test input, everyone works sometimes, spreading it
* testc			test input, two compartment, everyone has brief contact
* testd			test input, two compartment, fewer extended contacts

Instructions
------------

To build the epidemic simulator, use this shell command

	make

To make a web site of documentation from the javadoc comments in the code

        make html

To clean up files that were created by make

        make clean

To test or demonstrate the simulator, use one of these shell commands

	make demo	# equivalent to java Epidemic testa

	java Epidemic testa
	java Epidemic testb
	java Epidemic testc
	java Epidemic testd

Tests A and B should produce very similar results as a wave of infection
sweeps through the community until everyone has either recovered or died of
the simulated disease.

Tests C and D are bi-stable; they involve places named earth and mars, where
people from those planets travel to the moon and make brief contact.
Sometimes, the epidemic fails to spread between planets, sometimes, it
jumps the gap between planets and sweeps through both.

Tests A and C involve people following fixed schedules, while tests B and D
involve schedules with random elements, where the random elements have been
adjusted so that test B produces output similar to test A and D similar to C.
